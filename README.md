## Welcome to the REAL R Short Course!

This is the course page for the Summer 2021 iteration of the REAL R Short Course.  Here, we will share all of the course materials and information in a central location.

### Course Schedule

We will meet synchronously via Zoom on Wednesdays from July 21 through September 8 (for a total of 8 sessions).

Eastern time: 1PM - 2PM

Central time: 12 noon - 1PM

Mountain time: 11AM - 12 noon

Pacific time: 10AM - 11AM

### Week One

First, we will work on [Getting Started](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_GitHub.html), and will walk through computer set-up preliminaries.

Second, we will work through [R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_Activity.html), where we'll take our first foray into R.

Together, these two parts will serve as a starting point and foundation for the rest of our work together, and will set us up for discussions of graphing in Weeks 2 and 3!

### Between Week One and Week Two

We will place our instructions for your outside-of-class preparation work each week here!  There will often be a slight delay before this is posted, so that we can tailor the documents to our progress in the synchronous session.

### Week Two

Major topic - plotting in R

Details and documents: coming soon, stay tuned!


### Community Information

Here, we will provide information about the members of the learning community, so you can get to know your colleagues.
