## Welcome to the REAL R Short Course!

This is the course page for the Summer 2021 iteration of the REAL R Short Course.  Here, we will share all of the course materials and information in a central location.

### Course Schedule

We will meet synchronously via Zoom on Wednesdays from July 21 through September 8 (for a total of 8 sessions).

Eastern time: 1PM - 2PM

Central time: 12 noon - 1PM

Mountain time: 11AM - 12 noon

Pacific time: 10AM - 11AM

### Day One (July 21, 2021)

First, we will work on [Getting Started](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_GitHub.html), and will walk through computer set-up preliminaries.

Second, we will work through [R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://robertmerdmann.github.io/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/Day1/Day1_Activity.html), where we'll take our first foray into R.

Together, these two parts will serve as a starting point and foundation for the rest of our work together, and will set us up for discussions of graphing in Days 2 and 3!

### Between Day One and Day Two

Here is the Github location of the [Day 2 Prep Work](https://github.com/robertmerdmann/REALshortcourse_Summer2021/blob/c81c92a0ee073a3e064e666c572b8fdaa8702c7a/Day2PrepWork/Day2PrepWork.Rmd) - the file you need is named Day2PrepWork.Rmd - this is an RMarkdown document. If you are using Github Desktop and have cloned the class repository (REALshortcourse_Summer2021), you should be able to find this within the new Day2PrepWork folder.  You'll want to open this file in RStudio, and then edit/run code within the document itself.  The document provides the instructions needed as you go.  Have fun, and don't hesitate to reach out if you are running into difficulties! 

### Day Two (July 28, 2021)

Major topic - plotting in R

Details and documents: coming soon, stay tuned!
